<h2 class="material-heading">
    Digital signal representations

</h2>

<p>
  Digital image and audio signals represent recordings of natural
  signals in numerical form. For images, the values represent 
  pixel intensities stored in a two-dimensional array. A third
  dimension can be used to store different bands for, e.g.,
  red, green, and blue (RGB). We can also think of the values
  are functions of the x and y coordinates, F(x,y).
</p>

<p>
  <i>Fun fact (but not required for the exam):</i> In the case of
  audio, the signal can be thought to be a signal of time, F(t), but
  other representations such as those that are functions of frequency,
  F(f), are commonly used. The frequency representation is
  particularly well suited for compact representation since frequency
  bands outside the audible range 20 Hz to 20 kHz can be left out
  without observable (to humans) effect.
</p>

<h2 class="material-heading">
    Pattern recognition

</h2>

<p>
  <b>Pattern recognition</b> is a good example of an AI problem
  involving digital signals. It means generally the problem is
  recognizing an object in a signal (typically an image). The task is
  made hard because signals tend to vary greatly depending on external
  conditions such as camera angle, distance, lighting conditions, 
  echo, noise, and differences between recording devices. Therefore
  the signal is practically always different even if it is from the
  same object.
</p>

<p>
  Based on these facts, an essential requirement for successful
  pattern recognition is the extraction of <b>invariant features</b>
  in the signal. Such features are insensitive (or as insensitive as
  possible) to variation in the external conditions, and tend to be
  similar in recordings of the same object. In the lecture slides
  there is a famous photograph of
  an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl">Afghan
  girl</a> by Steve McCurry. She was identified based on the unique
  patterns in the iris of the eye. Here the iris is the invariant
  feature, which remains unchanged when a person grows older even if
  their appearance may otherwise change.  The iris is an example of
  invariance, and a metaphor for more general invariance with respect
  to external conditions.
</p>

<h2 class="material-heading">
    SIFT and SURF

</h2>

<p>
  Good examples of commonly used feature extraction techniques for
  image data include Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and
  Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF). We take a closer look at the
  SURF technique. It can be broken into two or three stages:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Choosing interest points:</b> We identify a set of (x,y)
      points by maximizing the determinant of a so called Hessian
      matrix that characterizes the local intensity variation 
      around the point. The interest points tend to be located
      at "blobs" in the image. (You are not required to decode the
      details of this -- a rough idea is enough.)
    <li>
      <b>Feature descriptors:</b> The intensity variation around each
      interest point is described by a feature descriptor which is a
      64-dimensional vector (array of 64 real values).  In addition,
      the feature has a scale (size) and an orientation (dominant
      direction).
    <li>
      <b>Feature matching:</b> If the problem is to match objects
      between two images, then both of the above tasks are performed
      on both images. We then find pairs of feature descriptors
      (one extracted from image A and the other from image B) that
      are sufficiently close to each other in Euclidean distance.
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Above is an example of detected features: interest point location,
  scale, and orientation shown by the circles, and the type of
  contrast shown by the color, i.e., dark on light background (red) or
  light on dark background (blue).  <i>Image credit:</i> NASA/Jet

  The TMC template for the pattern recognition task implements
  SURF feature extraction and matching. When you run the template,
  you should get the face example presented at the lecture.
</p>

<p>
  The red dots in the images are the locations of the SURF
  interest points. The lines between points in the two images
  represent matches, i.e., pairs of features whose descriptor
  vectors are sufficiently close to each other to be classified as 
  belonging to the same or similar looking object.
</p>

<p>
  Change the files <code>img1.jpg</code> and <code>img2.jpg</code> in
  the <code>example</code> folder to another pair of images, and
  rerun the template. <i>Note:</i> The images must be the same
  height. (Width can be different.)
</p>

<p>
  Try at least five different pairs of images, some of which include
  the same building, person, and/or object. Try to find examples
  where the feature matching works, and examples where it doesn't.

</p>

<p>
  Does SURF recognize the objects in the image as the same despite
  the alterations?
</p>

<p>
  <i>An alternative (more fun) way:</i> Take multiple photos of the
  same image from slightly different angles, different distances, 
  in different lighting conditions, with occlusion, etc.
  Does SURF recognize the object despite such changes in 
  external conditions?

<h1 class="material-heading">
    Natural Language Processing

</h1>

<p>
  Language is another example of an area where AI has hard time
  considering how easy it feels to us, as humans, to understand
  natural scenes or language. This is probably in part because
  we don't appreciate the hardness of tasks that even a child
  can perform without much apparent practice. (Of course, a
  child actually practices these skills very intensively, and
  in fact, evolution has trained us for millions of years,
  preconditioning our "neural networks" to process information
  in this form.)
</p>

<p>
  The features that make language distinctive and different from
  many other data sources for which we may apply AI techniques 
  include:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Even though language follows an obvious <b>linear structure</b>
      where a piece of text has a beginning and an end, and the words
      inbetween are in a given order, it also has <b>hierarchical</b>
      structures including, e.g.,
      text&ndash;paragraph&ndash;sentence&ndash;word relations,
      where each sentence, for example, forms a separate unit.
    <li>
      Grammar constrains the possible (allowed) expressions in natural
      languages but still leaves room for ambiguity (unlike formal
      languages such as programming languages which must be 
      unambiguous).
    <li>
      Compared to digital signals such as audio or image, natural
      language data is much closer to <b>semantics</b>: the idea
      of a chair has a direct correspondence with the word 'chair'
      but any particular image of a chair will necessarily carry
      plenty of additional information such as the color, size,
      material of the chair and even the lighting conditions, the
      camera angle, etc, which are completely independent of the
      chair itself.
  </ol>
</p>

<h2 class="material-heading">
    Formal languages and grammars

</h2>


<p>
  Natural language processing (NLP) applies many concepts from
  theoretical computer science which are applicable to the study of
  formal languages. A formal language is generally a set of
  strings. For example, the set of valid mathematical expressions is a
  formal language that includes the
  string <code>(1+2)&times;6&ndash;3</code> but not the string
  <code>1+(+&times;5(</code>. A <b>(formal) grammar</b> is a set
  of symbol manipulation rules that enables the generation of the
  valid strings (or "sentences") in the language.
</p>

<p>
  An important subclass of formal languages is <b>context-free
    languages</b>. A context-free language is defined by a
    context-free grammar, which is a grammar with rules of the
    form <code>V&xrarr;w</code>, where <code>V</code> is
    a <b>non-terminal symbol</b>, and <code>w</code> is a sequence of
    non-terminal or <b>terminal symbols</b>.  The context-free nature
    of the rules means that such a rule can be applied independently
    of the surrounding context, i.e., the symbols before or
    after <code>V</code>.
</p>

<p>
  An example will hopefully make the matter clear. Let <code>S</code>
  be a <b>start symbol</b>, which is also the only non-terminal symbol
  in the grammar. Let the set of terminal symbols be <code>()[]</code>.
  The set of rules is given by
<pre>
S &xrarr; SS
S &xrarr;
S &xrarr; (S)
S &xrarr; [S]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  The language defined by such a grammar is the set of strings that
  can be generated by repeated application of any of the above rules,
  starting with the start symbol <code>S</code>.
</p>

<p>
  For example, the string <code>()</code> can be generated by first
  applying the rule <code>S &xrarr; (S)</code> to the start symbol,
  whereupon we obtain the intermediate string <code>(S)</code>.
  Applying the rule <code>S &xrarr; </code> to the symbol <code>S</code>
  in the intermediate string, to obtain the final outcome
  <code>()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  As another example, the string <code>(())[]</code> also belongs to
  the language. Can you figure out a sequence of rules to generate it
  from the start symbol <code>S</code>? Notice that each application
  of a rule only applies to a single symbol in the intermediate
  string. So for example, if you apply the rule <code>S &xrarr; (S)</code>
  to the intermediate string <code>SS</code>, only one of the symbols
  gets parentheses around it (you are free to choose which one):
  <code>S(S)</code> or <code>(S)S</code>. If you want to apply the
  same rule to both symbols, you can, you just have to apply the same
  rule twice, which gives <code>(S)(S)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Try working out a sequence of rules to
  obtain <code>(())[]</code>. To check the correct answer, you can
  look at the example solution below but don't look before you've
  tried it by yourself.

      <code>(())[S]</code>
    <li><code>S &xrarr; </code> to the only <code>S</code>: result
      <code>(())[]</code>
  </ol>
</p>
        

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="material-heading">
    Parsing

</h2>

<p>
  Efficient algorithms for deciding whether a given string belongs to
  a given context-free language exist. They are based on <b>parsing</b>,
  which means the construction of a <b>parse tree</b>. The parse tree
  represents the hierarchical structure of the string. An example parse
  tree is shown below.
</p>
<img src="../img/diagrams/parse-tree-81cb0e66.png" width=30%><br><br>

<p>
  In the above tree, the sentence "she eats a fish with a fork" has
  two main components: "she" and the rest of the sentence. The rest of
  the sentence likewise has two parts: "eats" and "a fish with a
  fork".  The interpretation of this parse tree is that the object of
  eating is a fish that has a fork. (A possible but rather unusual
  scenario as fish rarely have forks.)
</p>

<p>
  The above parse tree demonstrates the ambiguity of natural language,
  which is a challenge to AI applications. A potential solution in
  such scenarios is to use the semantics of the words and to 
  attach word-dependent probabilities to different rules. This
  could for instance suggest that the probability of eating something
  with a fork is a more probable construction than a fish that
  has a fork. This method is called <b>lexicalized parsing</b>.
</p>



<h2 class="material-heading">
    CYK algorithm

</h2>

<p>
  The <b>Cooke&ndash;Younger&ndash;Kasami (CYK) algorithm</b> is an
  O(mn<sup>3</sup>) time algorithm for parsing context-free languages.
  Here n refers to the number of words in the sentence, and m is the
  number of rules in the grammar. It is based on dynamic programming
  where the sentence is parsed by first processing short substrings
  (sub-sentences) that form a part of the whole, and combining the
  results to obtain a parse tree for the whole sentence.
</p>

<p>
  To present the idea of the CYK algorihtm, we'll start with an example.
  In our naive example grammar, we have the following set of rules:<br><br>
  S &xrarr; NP VP<br>
  VP &xrarr; V NP<br>
  VP &xrarr; VP ADV<br>
  VP &xrarr; V<br>
  NP &xrarr; N<br>
  V &xrarr; fish<br>
  N &xrarr; Robots<br>
  N &xrarr; fish<br>
  ADV &xrarr; today<br><br>
  The starting symbol is again S, which stands for both 'start' as well
  as 'sentence'. NP stands for noun-phrase, VP for verb-phrase, V and N
  are of course verb and noun respectively, and finally ADV stands
  for adverb (a specifier that says <i>how</i> or <i>when</i> something
  is done).
</p>

<p>
  The terminal symbols &mdash; note that here we consider words 
  as atomic symbols, and not sequences of characters &mdash; are
  'fish', 'Robots', and 'today'. Also note that the word 'fish'
  is both a verb (V) and a noun (N).

    CYK table

</h3>


<p>
  A fundamental data structure in CYK is a triangular table that is
  usually depicted as a lower-triangular (or upper-triangular) matrix
  of size n &times; n. The completed table for our small example is 
  below. This would be the result of running the CYK algorithm with
  the sentence "Robots fish fish today" as input.

<p>
  First of all, pay attention to the numbering scheme of the table cells.
  Each cell is numbered as shown in the top right corner:
  (1,4), (1,3), etc. The numbering may be slighly confusing since it
  doesn't follow the more usual <i>(row, column)</i> numbering.
  Instead, the numbers given the start and the end of the sub-sentence
  that the cell corresponds to. For example, the cell (1,4) refers to
  the whole sentence, i.e., words 1&ndash;4, while the cell (2,3) 
  refers to the words <i>fish fish</i>, i.e., words 2&ndash;3.
</p>

<p>
  After the algorihtm is completed, the contents of the cells in the
  CYK table correspond to the possible interpretations (if any) of the
  words in question in terms of different non-terminals. For example,
  the words <i>fish fish</i> are seen to have two interpretations: as
  a sentence (S) and as a verb-phrase (VP). This is because we can
  generate these two words by starting either from S or VP.
</p>

<p>
  Just to keep you on your toes, let's make sure you understand what
  we mean when we say that <i>fish fish</i> can be generated from S
  and VP. That is, give a list of rules to generate these two words
  starting from S, and then do the same starting from VP.
</p>

<div class="solution" data-target='collapse'>
  <div class="solution__header">
    <a data-toggle="collapse" class="solution__toggle">
      <i class="fa fa-magic solution__icon"></i>
      <h1 class="solution__heading">Answer (look only

    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="collapse">
    <div class="solution__body">
      
<p>
  Starting from S, we first apply the only rule that has S on the
  left, i.e., S &xrarr; NP VP. Then apply NP &xrarr; N to obtain
  N VP, and VP &xrarr; V, to obtain N V. Finally, apply N &xrarr; fish
  and V &xrarr; fish to obtain "fish fish".
</p>

<p>
  Starting from VP, apply VP &xrarr; V NP. Then, apply V &xrarr; fish,
  NP &xrarr; N, and finally N &xrarr; fish.
</p>

<p>
  The interpretations of "fish fish" as a sentence (S) and a
  verb-phrase (VP) are quite different. In the former, the first
  'fish' is generated through NP and N, i.e., the first word is
  considered a noun, while the second 'fish' is generated through
  VP and V, i.e., it is considered a verb. So there are some sea
  creatures (the first 'fish') that try to catch other sea creatures.
  On the other hand, in the VP interpretation, the first 'fish'
  is generated through V, so it is a verb, and the second 'fish'
  is a noun. This time the interpretation is that what is going on is
  an attempt to catch some sea creatures but it is not explicated who
  is fishing since the words only form a verb-phrase that can be
  combined with a subject noun.
</p>

<p>
  The other elements in the table have similar interpretations.  The
  above example is actually somewhat unusual in the sense that all
  sub-sentences can be parsed and therefore, all cells in the table
  contain at least one non-terminal symbol. This is by no means a
  general property. For example, "Robots Robots Robots" wouldn't
  have an interpretation as a valid sub-sentence in a grammatical
  sentence, and the table for a sentence containing these words
  (consecutively) would have empty cells.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Operation of the algorithm

</h3>


<p>
  The CYK algorithm operates by processing one row of the table at a
  time, starting from the bottom row which corresponds to one-word
  sub-sentences, and working its way to the top node that corresponds
  to the whole sentence. This shows the dynamic programming nature of
  the algorithm: the short sub-sentences are parsed first and used
  in parsing the longer sub-sentences and whole sentence.
</p>

<p>
  More specifically, the algorithm tries to find on each row any rules
  that could have generated the corresponding symbols. On the bottom
  row, we can start by finding rules that could have generated each
  individual word. So for example, we notice that the word 'Robots'
  could have been generated (only) by the rule N &xrarr; Robots, and
  so we add N into the cell (1,1).  Likewise we add both V and N into
  the cells (2,2) and (3,3) because the word 'fish' could have been
  generated from either V or N. At this stage, the CYK table would
  look as follows:
</p>

<p>

<p>
  The same procedure is repeated as long as there are rules that we
  haven't applied yet in a given cell. This implies that we will also
  apply the rule NP &xrarr; N in the cell (1,1) after having added the
  symbol N in it, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Only after we have made sure that no other rules can be applied on
  the bottom row, we move one row up. Now we will also
  consider <b>binary rules</b> where the right side has two symbols. A
  binary rule can be applied in a given cell if the two symbols on the
  right side of the rule are found in cells that correspond to
  splitting the sub-sentence in the current cell into two consecutive
  parts. This means that in cell (1,2) for example, we can split the
  sub-sentence 'Robots fish' into two parts that correspond to cell
  (1,1) and (2,2) respectively. As these two cells contain the symbols
  NP and VP, and the rule S &xrarr; NP VP contains exactly these
  symbols on the right side, we can add the symbol S on the left side
  of the rule into the cell (1,2).

<p>
  This process is iterated until again we can't apply more rules on the
  second row from the bottom, after which we move one level up. 
  This is repeated on all levels until we reach the top node and
  the algorithm terminates.
</p>

<p>
  Pseudocode for the CYK algorithm is as follows:
</p>

<pre class="sh_java code-highlight"><code>1:  T = n x n array of empty lists
2:  for i in 1,...,n:
3:     T[i,i] = [word[i]]
4:  for len = 0,...,n-1:
5:     while rule can be applied:
6:        if x &xrarr; T[i,i+len] for some x:
7:           add x in T[i,i+len]
8:        if x &xrarr; T[i,i+k] T[i+k+1,i+len] for some k,x:
9:           add x in T[i,i+len]
</code></pre>

<p>
  The variable <code>len</code> refers to the length of the
  sub-sentence being processed in terms of the distance between
  its start and end. So for example, in the first iteration of the
  loop on lines 4&ndash;9, we process individual words in cell
  (1,1), (2,2), ..., (7,7), and so <code>len = 0</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>if</code> statements on lines 6 and 8 check whether there
  exists a rule where the symbol(s) on the right side are found in the
  specific cells given in the pseudodode (<code>T[i,i+len]</code> on
  line 6, or <code>T[i,i+k]</code> and <code>T[i+k+1,i+len]</code> on
  line 8). If this is the case, then the symbol <code>x</code> on the
  left side of the rule is added into
  cell <code>T[i,i+len]</code>. This means that the sub-sentence
  (i,i+len) can be generated from symbol <code>x</code>.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Constructing parse trees from the CYK table

</h3>

<p>
  What is not shown in the pseudocode, is that we should also keep
  track of how we obtained each entry in the CYK table. Each time we
  apply a rule, we should therefore store the symbol(s) in the other
  cell(s) where the symbols on the right side of the rule were
  found. For example, in the very last step of the algorithm in the
  above example, we would store that the symbol S was obtained because
  we found NP in cell (1,1) and VP in cell (2,4), etc. Note that it is
  important to store references not only the cell but also the
  individual symbols that were used.
</p>

<p>
  If there are multiple ways to obtain a given symbol in a given cell,
  then we store information about each possible way as a separate set
  of references. These different ways will correspond to different
  ways to parse the sentence.
</p>

<p>
  Having stored the references to the symbols that enabled us to
  obtain the symbols in the higher rows of the table, we can
  reconstruct parse trees by traversing the references between the
  symbols, starting from the symbol S in top node (if one exists; if
  there is no S in the top node, the sentence is invalid/not
  grammatical, and it doesn't belong to the language at all).
</p>

<p>
  In the above example there should be only one possible parse
  tree but the lecture slides and the next exercise show cases
  where there are more than one.

<p>
  The notation VP<sup>3</sup> indicated that the symbol VP can be
  obtained in three different ways from the entries in the other
  cells. This also indicates that when building the parse trees, we
  obtain multiple different trees depending on which instance of VP we
  choose to expand. The three different ways to obtain the VP entry in
  (2,7) are: <i>(i)</i> from (2,5) (VP) and (6,7) (PP) using the rule
  VP &xrarr; VP PP; <i>(ii)</i> from (2,3) (VP) and (4,7) (PP) using
  the rule VP &xrarr; VP PP; <i>(iii)</i> from (2,2) (V) and (3,7) (NP)
  using the rule VP &xrarr; V NP.
</p>

<p>
  Likewise, the symbol VP in cell (2,5) and the symbol NP in cell
  (3,7) can be obtained in two different ways.
</p>

<p>
  The number of distinct parse trees that can be formed based on the
  CYK table is five, see below. The most sensible of them is the
  bottom one: in it, the subject is Google, and what they did is to
  buy something (DeepMind) for some amount of money ($500M) at some
  time (in January), i.e., both "for $500M" and "in January" are
  additional specifiers that are attached to the buying.  On the other
  hand, the first (top-left) parse tree, for instance, would be
  interpreted so that the object of buying is "DeepMind for $500M in
  January", which doesn't really constitute a meaningful expression
  (think for example what "This is DeepMind for $500M in January."
  would mean). Furthermore, the first parse tree includes the subtree
  "$500M in January", which is also an odd expression since $500M
  in January should be pretty much the same as $500M in February
  (expect perhaps if you consider inflation-adjustment).

  You'll find a template for this exercise in TMC.</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Implement method <code>extractSubject</code> in
      class <code>Extractor</code>. The input will be a parse
      tree of a sentence. You should try to identify the <b>subject</b> of
      the sentence (<i>who/what</i> does something). One heuristic method
      that doesn't always work, but is close enough, is as follows:
      <ol>
	<li>Assume that the root node of the parse tree, S, has
	  children NP (noun phrase) and VP (verb phrase).  If this
	  is not the case, you can skip the sentence and return null.
	<li>Choose the child NP.
	<li>The subject can be assumed to a noun in the NP subtree
	  (see example below). You can identify nouns by the POS-tag
	  which should be either NN, NNP, NNPS, or NNS.
	<li>Use breadth-first search to find the noun closest to the root.<br>
	  <img src="../img/exercises/ex5/parsetree-68893fca.png" width=65%>
      </ol>
<br><br>

      
      The TMC template has tests to verify your solution.<br><br>
    <li>
      Next, implement the following logic in method <code>main</code>
      in class <code>Main</code> using the tools available in class
      <code>NLPUtils</code>: The template has ready-made functionality
      for iterating through all sentences in Franz Kafka's
      <i>The Metamorphosis</i>. Reject all sentences that don't contain
      the word "Gregor".<br><br>
    <li>
      For all remaining sentences, produce a 
      parsing tree. (If the parsing fails, reject the sentence.) Use the
      method you implemented in item 1 to identify the subject of the
      sentence. Print out all sentences where the subject is "Gregor".
      <br><br>
    <li>
      Use the output to find out what Gregor does in a similar spirit
      as this <a href="http://hint.fm/seer/#left=google%20is&right=artificial%20intelligence%20is">cool applet</a>. (No, you <i>don't</i> have to make
      a visualization!)
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Hint:</i> In item 2, you can use method <code>contains</code>.

</p>

<p>
  <b>Note added on Oct 6, 8.10pm:</b> there was a bug in the exercise
  template that has now been fixed. The problem manifested itself in
  a <code>java.util.zip.ZipException</code>. Unfortunately the TMC
  plugin is unable to correct the problem in template updates so if
  you're having this problem, you'll have to delete the NLP exercise
  folder from you computer and download the exercise again. If you're
  using Netbeans, the NLP folder should be in your NetBeansProjects.
