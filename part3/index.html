  Last week we practiced game algorithms, Minimax and alpha-beta
  pruning, on the simple game of tic-tac-toe. Tic-tac-toe is a good
  choice for understanding the basic principles and simulating the
  algorithms step-by-step. However, it is hardly a very cool
  AI application.
</p>

<p>
  Now we'll change gears and go for what used to be thought as a some
  kind of a "grand challenge" for AI, namely chess! (In fact, that's
  not exactly true since we'll be playing a variant of chess,
  called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_chess">Los
    Alamos chess</a> which is played on a 6 x 6 board with no bishops.)
</p>

<p>
  Implementing the complete game engine with all the rules is somewhat
  tedious, so we have done it for you. Also, since you've already
  implemented alpha-beta pruning last week, you don't have to do it
  again here. Instead, your task is to implement a <strong>
    heuristic evaluation function</strong>. The performance of the
  chess bot is in part determined by the goodness of the evaluation
  function, so designing a good one is critical for creating a
  competitive bot.
</p>

<p>
  To make things exciting, we'll have a <strong>chess-bot
  tournament</strong>. You will submit your solution (the heuristic
  evaluation function) on our server and compete against our own
  contender, <i>Deep Glue</i> and bots by other students. May the
  best bot win!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download the Java template <a href="https://materiaalit.github.io/intro-to-ai-17/files/Chesspackage.zip">here</a>. <strong>NB: There was an error (old version) in the
      package and it was fixed on Sept 21, 4.20pm. If you have problems
      uploading to the server, please reload the new package and try again.</strong>
  <li>
    Implement the method <code>double eval(Position p)</code> in class
    <code>YourEvaluator</code>. The method takes as its input a board
    position <code>p</code> which specifies the positions of all the
    pieces on the board and which player's turn it is. The return value
    should be the higher the more likely the white player is to win.
  <li>
    You can upload the compiled <code>YourEvaluator</code> class
    (i.e., the <code>class</code> file) on
    the <a href="http://ejaasaar.users.cs.helsinki.fi/">tournament
    server</a>. (If you use multiple classes, you can also upload a JAR
    file.)
  <li>
    Once you have uploaded your bot, you can play it against the other
    bots. You gain points by winning and lose points by losing. The
    highest ranked bot will be declared the champion at the end of the
    course. (One week before the exam.)

<h2 class="material-heading">
    Bayes rule and probabilistic inference

</h2>

<p>
  Bayes rule has a central role in statistical inference and machine
  learning. The basis for this is that it can be applied in scenarios
  where one of the random variables in the model corresponds to an
  unknown "state" which we are interested to learn. If the model
  includes other variables that correspond to "observations" that
  can be made and that are dependent on the unknown state, we
  can use the Bayes rule as follows
</p>
<img src="../img/drawings/posterior_prior_likelihood-279c07c5.png" width=83% alt="P(state | observation) = P(state) P(observation | state) / P(observation)">
<p>
  The left side of the equation is called the <strong>posterior
  probability</strong> (probability after the observation).
  The first factor on the right is called the <strong>prior
    probability</strong> (probability prior to the observation),
  the middle factor is called the <strong>likelihood</strong>
  (how likely the observation is when the state is given), and
  the last term on the right has many names, of which 
  <strong>the annoying denominator</strong> may be the most
  fitting. (Evidence and marginal likelihood are more
  common.)
</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="hint__header">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle hint__icon"></i>On (not) calculating the annoying denominator
  </div>

  <div class="hint__body">
    
<p>
  As you may have noticed, when completing last week's exercises,
  and as you will notice at the latest when completing this week's,
  calculating the denominator may indeed be annoying.
</p>

<p>
  A nice trick that can sometimes save a lot of effort is to
  calculate the <strong>ratio</strong> of posterior probabilities,
  instead of the probabilities themselves. For example, consider
  the following ratio
</p>
<pre>
     R = P(State=1 | obs) / P(State=2 | obs)
</pre>
<p>
  where <code>obs</code> is an abbreviation for observation. 
  Applying Bayes rule to both the numerator and the denominator
  in the ratio, we'll notice that the denominator <code>P(obs)</code>
  cancels:
</p>
<pre>
     P(State=1) P(obs | State=1) / P(obs)   P(State=1) P(obs | State=1)
R =  ------------------------------------ = ---------------------------
     P(State=2) P(obs | State=2) / P(obs)   P(State=2) P(obs | State=2)
</pre>
<p>
  In case the two states (1 and 2) are the only possibilities, we
  have <code>P(State=2|obs) = 1-P(State=1|obs)</code> (because one of
  the events must happen and both cannot occur at the same time).
  In this case, after calculating the the above ratio, <code>R</code>,
  it can be mapped back into the posterior probability of state 1 by
</p>
<pre>
  P(State=1 | obs) = R / (1+R)
</pre>
<p>
  You can check that this is true by assigning and using the
  fact <code>P(State=2|obs) = 1-P(State=1|obs)</code>.
</p>


  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="material-heading">
    Naive Bayes classification

</h2>

<p>
  One of the most useful applications of the Bayes rule is the so
  called <strong>naive Bayes classifier</strong>. It is a machine
  learning technique that can be used to <strong> classify</strong>
  objects such as text documents into two or more classes. The
  classifier is trained by analysing a set of <strong>training
  data</strong>, for which the correct classes are given.
</p>

<p>
  The naive Bayes model is a probabilistic model that involves a class
  variable -- this corresponds to the state variable above -- and a
  number of feature variables. The assumption in the model is that the
  feature variables are <strong> conditionally independent</strong>
  given the class.  (We will not discuss the exact meaning of
  conditional independence on this course. You can find more about it
  from the literature. For our purposes, it is enough to be able to
  exploit conditional independence in building the classifier.)
</p>

<p>
  We will use a <strong>spam email filter</strong> as a running
  example for illustrating the idea of the naive Bayes
  classifier. Thus, the class variable indicates whether a message is
  spam (or "junk email") or whether it is a legitimate message (also
  called "ham").  The words in the message correspond to the feature
  variables, so that the number of feature variables in the model
  is determined by the length of the message.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="../img/diagrams/nbmodel-e74b4b40.png" width=65%>
</p>

<p>
  The naive Bayes model can be represented as a <strong>Bayesian
    network</strong>, which encodes the conditional independence
  between the feature variables (in this case, the words of the
  email message) given the class variable as in the above diagram.
  We'll return to Bayesian networks in the next section below.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Estimating parameters

</h3>

<p>
  To define the naive Bayes model, we need to specify the distribution
  of each variable. For the class variable, this is the distribution
  of spam vs ham messages, which we can for simplicity assume to be
  1:1, i.e., <code>P(spam) = P(ham) = 0.5</code>.
</p>

<p>
  For the feature variables, we will define two distributions: one for
  the spam messages and another one for the ham messages. In each case,
  we will make the simplifying assumption that each of the words in the
  message is distributed according to the same distribution. And as we
  said above, we also assume that the words are independent of each 
  other given the spam/ham class.
</p>

<p>
  The word distributions for the two classes are
  best <strong>estimated</strong> from actual training data, i.e., a
  corpus of spam messages and a corpus of legitimate messages. The
  simplest way is to count how many times each word, <code>aardvark,
  aardwolf, ..., Zyzzogeton</code>, appears in the corpus and dividing
  the number by the total number of words in the corpus.
</p>

<p>
  To illustrate the idea, let's assume that we have at our disposal
  both a spam corpus and a ham corpus. You can easily obtain one
  by saving a batch of your emails in two files.
</p>

<p>
  Assume that we have calculated the number of occurrences of the
  following words in the two classes of messages:
</p>
<pre>
        word    spam     ham
 ----------- ------- -------
 million         156      98
 dollars          29     119
 adclick          51       0
 conferences       0      12
 ----------- ------- -------
       total   95791  306438
</pre>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="hint__header">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle hint__icon"></i>Watch out for the Singularity!
  </div>

  <div class="hint__body">
    
<p>
  One problem with estimating the probabilities directly from the
  counts is that the zero counts lead to zero estimates. This can be
  quite harmful for the performance of the classifier -- it easily
  leads to situations where the ratio of the posterior probabilities
  obtained as 0/0. That sounds dangerously close to the Singularity,
  so we'd better find a better way. The simplest solution is to use a
  small lower bound for all probability estimates. The value 0.000001,
  for instance, does the job.
</p>


  </div>
</div>

<p>
  We can now estimate that the probability that a word in a spam
  message is <code>million</code>, for example, is about 156/95791
  &asymp; 0.0016285. In other words, on the average, roughly every
  614th word in a spam message is <code>million</code>. Likewise, we
  get the estimate 0.0003198 for the probability that a word in a ham
  message is <code>million</code>. Both of these probability estimates
  are small but more importantly, the former is higher than the
  latter. This turns out to be a sign that the word in question hints
  towards the message being spam -- which sounds logical. Words for
  which the ratio of the probabilities is the other way around, hint
  towards the message being ham.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Classifying new data

</h3>

<p>
  After the parameters of the model have been estimated, the
  classifier is ready for use! When we are given a new message, we
  will compute the posterior probability <code>P(spam |
  message)</code>, where <code>message</code> is a place-holder for
  the words in the message, for example, <code>P(spam | 'million',
  'conferences')</code> (which would be a really short message).
</p>

<p>
  Let's compute the posterior probability
</p>
<pre>
     P(spam | Word1 = 'million', Word2 = 'conferences')
</pre>
<p>
  which is abbreviated without a great risk of confusion -- but please
  note that unlike <code>million</code> and <code>conferences</code>,
  which are hyphenated ('like this') to indicate that they are words that occur
  in the message, the term <code>spam</code> indicates
  the <i>class</i> of the message, not the word "spam" -- as
</p>
<pre>
     P(spam | 'million', 'conferences')
</pre>
<p>
  By Bayes rule, we have
</p>
<pre>
                                      P(spam) P('million', 'conferences' | spam)
 P(spam | 'million', 'conferences') = ------------------------------------------
                                            P('million', 'conferences')
</pre>
<p>
  The numerator on the right side is the likelihood term and its meaning
  is the probability that the first two words are <code>million</code>
  and <code>conferences</code> given that the message is spam. The
  denominator on the right side -- it's the annoying one -- is the
  probability that the first two words are as stated when the spam/ham
  status of the message is <strong>not</strong> given.
</p>

<p>
  Let's look at the likelihood term first. The conditional independence
  assumption, i.e., the naive Bayes assumption, implies that the
  likelihood can be "factorized" as follows
</p>
<pre>
  P('million', 'conferences' | spam) = P('million' | spam) P('conferences' | spam)
</pre>
<p>
  This is very useful since these are the kind of probabilities we
  have estimated from the data. The same factorization rule can be
  applied no matter how many words there are in the message.
</p>

<p>
  Next up is the annoying denominator. However, we'll use the hint above
  and avoid calculating the denominator (at least explicitly). To achieve
  this, we consider the ratio of posteriors:
</p>
<pre>
 P(spam | 'million', 'conferences')   P(spam) P('million', 'conferences' | spam) / Z
 ---------------------------------- = ----------------------------------------------
  P(ham | 'million', 'conferences')    P(ham) P('million', 'conferences' | ham) / Z
</pre>
<p>
  where Z, defined as <code>Z = P('million', 'conferences')</code>,
  is the annoying denominator which cancels out just as promised in the hint.
</p>

<p>
  The term <code>P('million', 'conferences' | ham)</code> is treated in the exact
  same manner as the term corresponding term for spam (see above), and the
  numbers required to calculate its value are available since we have
  estimated them from the training data.
</p>

<p>
  The following exercises will demonstrate the use of the naive Bayes
  model.

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Implementation details

</h3>

<p>
  The above exercise should make it relatively straightforward to see
  how the filter can be implemented by programming: the key insight is
  the routine nature of the word-by-word calculations.
</p>

<p>
  A convenient way to group the computations is obtained by slight
  reshuffling of the terms. Consider still our example two-word message,
  and the following formula for the ratio of the posterior probabilities
</p>
<pre>
     P(spam | 'million', 'conferences') 
 R = ----------------------------------  
      P(ham | 'million', 'conferences')

     P(spam) P('million' | spam) P('conferences' | spam)
   = ---------------------------------------------------
       P(ham) P('million' | ham) P('conferences' | ham)
</pre>
<p>
  Since the ratio of products is equal to the product of ratios -- i.e.,
  for example, (ABC)/(DEF) = (A/D)(B/E)(C/F) -- we can group the above terms as
</p>
<pre>
     P(spam)  P('million' | spam)  P('conferences' | spam)
 R = -------  -------------------  -----------------------
     P(ham)   P('million' | ham)   P('conferences' | ham)
</pre>
<p>
  More generally, the formula is
</p>
<pre>
       P(spam)  N  P(word_i | spam)
   R = -------  &Pi;  ----------------
       P(ham)  i=1 P(word_i | ham)
</pre>
<p>
  where N is the number of words in the message, and <code>word_i</code> is the
  i'th word in the message.
</p>

<p>
  Intuitively, the above formula encodes the rule that any word whose
  probability is higher in spam messages than in ham messages will
  increase the ratio R, and vice versa. For example, in our two-word
  message, for <i>i</i>=1, we have <code>word_i =
  'million'</code>, and the ratio of the word probabilities is
  given by
</p>
<pre>
    P(word_1 | spam)   P('million' | spam)   0.0016285
    ---------------- = ------------------- &asymp; --------- &asymp; 5.1 
    P(word_1 | ham)    P('million' | ham)    0.0003198
</pre>
<p>
  Thus, each occurrence of the word <code>'million'</code> in the message
  leads to roughly a five-fold increase in the posterior probability ratio.
</p>

<p>
  Putting things together, here's a pseudocode sketch of the classification
  stage where we assume that the probability estimates have already been
  calculated from training data.
</p>

<pre class="sh_java code-highlight"><code>1:  spamicity(words, estimates):
2:     R = estimates.prior_spam / estimates.prior_ham
3:     for each w in words:
4:        R = R * estimates.spam_prob(w) / estimates.ham_prob(w)
5:     return R
</code></pre>

<p>
  Here <code>estimates</code> is an object that stores the estimated
  probabilities: <code>estimates.prior_spam</code> is the probability that
  a message is spam, P(spam), <code>estimates.prior_ham</code> the same
  for ham; <code>estimates.spam_prob(w)</code> is the probability
  <code>P(Word = w | spam)</code>, and <code>estimates.ham_prob(w)</code>
  the same for ham.

  When dealing with long messages, the posterior probability ratio becomes
  a product with very many terms. This can easily lead to trouble because
  products are creatures that easily grow very very large or very very small
  (close to zero); the mathematical term is 'exponential rate'.
</p>

<p>
  In order to reduce the risk of under- and overflows in the floating
  point arithmetics, it is a good idea to carry out the computations
  in log-scale.  That is, instead of computing the ratio, R, you
  should compute its logarithm, log(R). (Store the log-ratio in a variable
  like <code>logR</code>.)
</p>

<p>
  The important thing to recall about logarithms is that they convert
  multiplication into addition: log(AB) = log(A) + log(B); and similarly,
  division becomes subtraction: log(A/B) = log(A) &ndash; log(B). Using these,
  we can write the log-ratio as
</p>
<pre>
                                       N
   logR = log(P(spam)) - log(P(ham)) + &Sigma; [log(P(word_i | spam)) - log(P(word_i | ham))]
                                      i=1
</pre>
<p>
  The base of the logarithm (natural, 2, 10, ...) is not
  consequential. The important thing is to map the end result back to
  the ratio by exponentiating the log-ratio with the same base. So if
  you use natural logarithms, for instance, then you should
  exponentiate the log-ratio by <code>exp(logR)</code> to get R.

  Next you get to implement a naive Bayes spam filter by
  programming. The Java template is available on TMC. (In case you
  prefer to use another programming language, feel free to. You can
  find the ready-made spam and ham word count
  files, <code>spamcount.txt</code> and <code>hamcount.txt</code> in
  the template.)
</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Download the template and take a look at the word count files in
      the template, which originally come from the development team of
      the <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>
      spam filter. The common "stop-words" that are uninteresting for
      our present purpose, such as <i>the, a, to, ...</i> have been
      removed, as have words that occur only once. The files are
      sorted so that the most common words in the respective class
      come first:
      <pre>

	top 10 spam words: top 10 ham words:
        ------------------ -----------------
         624 free          1776 list

      </pre>
      The total number of unique words in the spam messages is 6245, and the
      total word count is 75268. The ham messages have 16207 unique words and
      the total word count is 290673.
    <lI>
      Estimate the conditional probabilities <code>P(Word=s | spam)</code>
      and <code>P(Word=s | ham)</code> for all words <code>s</code> that occur
      in the files. For example, you should get the estimate <code>P('free' | spam)</code>
      &asymp; 0.00829.
    <li>
      Now implement a filter that reads a new message and calculates the probability
      that it is spam using the naive Bayes model, following the instructions
      above.
    <li>
      Test your classifiers by running it on the two example messages that come with
      the TMC template <code>spamesim.txt</code> (which should classified as spam) and
      <code>hamesim.txt</code> (which should be classified as ham).
      You can also try your spam filter on your own email messages.
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Hint:</i> In item 3, you may encounter words that you haven't 
  encountered in the training data at all. You can use the small constant
  lower bound for them.

<h2 class="material-heading">
    Bayesian networks

</h2>

<p>
  As we mentioned above, the naive Bayes model is a kind of a Bayesian
  network, with an associated graph structure where the class variable
  is the root and the only "parent" of all the feature variables.
</p>

<p>
  Bayesian networks are a model family which belong to the still more
  general category
  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model">(probabilistic)
  graphical models</a>, which are a modeling "language" for
  probabilistic models. The power of graphical models is mainly due to
  i) their ability to compactly represent multivariate domains with
  complex dependencies, and ii) efficient inference procedures that
  exploit the structure of the models.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Building blocks of a Bayesian network

</h3>

<p>
  A Bayesian network will represent a joint distribution over a number
  of random variables. Depending on the complexity of the network
  (which depends on the number of placement of the edges in the
  graph), the Bayesian network representation may require
  significantly fewer numerical parameters than the number of
  elementary events in the domain.
</p>

<p>
  The structure of the network is encoded as a graph where each random
  variable is represented as a node, and the dependency structure is
  characterized by a set of directed edges between the nodes. The
  graph must be a <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong> (DAG), which
  means that it is impossible to start from a node follow a path in
  the direction of the edges to arrive at the same node. 
</p>

<p>
  Here's an example DAG:<br>
<img src="../img/diagrams/BNexample1-5591f5d5.png" width=30%>
</p>

<p>
  The random variables in the model are X,Y,Z, and &Aring;. (For the
  non-Scandi students, the last one is what we call the "Swedish O" in
  Finland;
  see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85">Wikipedia:&Aring;</a>.
  It conveniently comes after X, Y, and Z in our alphabet.) The edges
  correspond to <strong>direct</strong> dependency, so that
  the <i>absence</i> of an edge between any two variables means that
  the variables are conditionally independent given some (possibly
  empty) set of other variables. The details of this are slightly too
  complicated to discuss here, so we'll not go into them. For now, it
  is enough to remember that the edges are a way to encode the 
  dependency structure in the domain.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the structure encoded as the DAG, a Bayesian network
  comes with a set of parameters quantifying the conditional
  distributions of the variables. These are given in the form P(V=v |
  Pa<sub>V</sub> = pa<sub>V</sub>), where V is a random variable and v
  is a value, and Pa<sub>V</sub> denotes the <strong>parents</strong>
  of node V in the graph: i.e., the nodes from which there is an edge
  to V. For example, in the above DAG, we have Pa<sub>Z</sub> = {X,Y},
  and Pa<sub>Y</sub> = &empty; because node Y has no parents at all.
</p>

<p>
  When the variables are categorical, i.e., they take values in a finite
  set, the conditional distributions can be specified as 
  <strong>conditional probability tables</strong> (CPTs). A CPT for
  variable V includes the distribution of V for each possible
  combination of the values of V's parents. We call such combinations
  <strong>parent configurations</strong>. For example, if in the above
  example network, all variables are binary, then the parent configurations
  of Z are (X=0, Y=0), (X=0, Y=1), (X=1, Y=0), (X=1, Y=1), and the CPT
  of Z will have four rows, each containing a conditional distribution
  for Z. A concrete example is as follows
</p>

<p>
  <table style="background-color: #7fb3d5; text-align: center;">
    <tr>
      <td colspan=2></td><td colspan=2>Z</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;X&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;Y&nbsp;</td><td>0</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td><td>0</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>&nbsp;0.9&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td><td>1</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>0.2</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>0.8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td><td>0</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>0.5</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td><td>1</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>0.0</td><td bgcolor=ecf0f1>1.0</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

<p>
  So for instance, if X=1 and Y=0, then the conditional probability of Z=1
  is given by P(Z=1 | X=1, Y=0) = 0.5, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  For a variable that has no parents in the network, the CPT is actually
  just a single distribution, and the CPT has only one row. For variables
  that have many parents, the CPT may easily become very very large.
</p>

<p>
  To make things concrete, we use a running example which is the
  car Bayesian network discussed at the lecture. Its structure is
  the following:<br>
<img src="../img/diagrams/carBN-f8e83c71.png" width=50%>
</p>

<p>

    [G]as
    [S]tarts

  Just to take an example, the car will start (S=1) with probability
  0.99 in case the ignition works (I=1) and there is gasoline in the tank (G=1).
  (No Tesla obviously). If there's a problem either with the ignition <i>or</i>
  the gasoline, then the car won't start for sure, i.e., P(S=1 | I=i, G=g) = 0.0 for
  all other combinations (i,g) than (1,1).
</p>

<p>
  The structure (the DAG) and the parameters in the CPTs are the
  building blocks of a Bayesian network. Next we dicuss how they
  represent a joint distribution and how they can be used to 
  perform inference about the domain.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Defining a probabilistic model as a Bayesian network

</h3>

<p>
  A probabilistic model is really nothing but a joint distribution
  over the random variables in the domain. The joint distribution
  defines the probability of each elementary event, which are
  equivalent to joint value assignments for the random variables.
  In the car domain, an elementary event is defined by six bits,
  B,R,I,G,S,M. For example, the event 1,1,1,1,1,1 would be a good
  day: the battery is alive, you listen to some good music, the
  car starts because you remembered to fill the tank yesterday, and
  you make it to the lecture in time.
</p>

<p>
  The joint probability of any elementary event is obtained as the
  product of the conditional probabilities of the form P(V=v |
  Pa<sub>V</sub> = pa<sub>V</sub>), where you'll recall Pa<sub>V</sub>
  refers to the parent set of V. In the car domain, the product is
  thus of the form:<br><br>
  P(B=b,R=r,I=i,G=g,S=s,M=m) =
  P(B=b) P(R=r | B=b) P(I=i | B=b) P(G=g) P (S=s | I=i,G=g) P(M=m | S=s),<br><br>
  where b,r,i,g,s, and m denote values of the respective random
  variables. The above formula is called a <strong>factorization</strong>
  of the joint probability.
</p>



<div class="hint">
  <div class="hint__header">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle hint__icon"></i>On short-hand notation
  </div>

  <div class="hint__body">
    
<p>
  To make it easier to interpret the events we won't use the rather
  long notation like B=1,R=1,I=1,G=1,S=1,M=1 or even the shorter
  notation like 1,1,1,1,1,1 to denote events in the car
  domain. Rather, we'll have a different label for the values of each
  of the random variables. For the variable Battery, we denote the
  good case (battery is alive) by B and the bad case by &not;B.
  Similarly, for Radio, we denote the good case (music is played) by
  R, and the bad case by &not;R, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  This is actually slight abuse of notation since we also denote the
  corresponding variables by the initial letters, B, R, etc, but we
  hope the meaning is clear enough.
</p>


  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The probability of a good day with the car is<br><br>
  P(B) P(R|B) P(I|B) P(G) P(S|I,G) P(M|S)
  = 0.9 &times; 0.9 &times; 0.95 &times; 0.95 &times; 0.99 &times 99
  &asymp; 0.716.<br><br>
  Pay close attention to the form of the terms, and make sure you could
  choose the right values from the above CPTs to do the above
  calculation.
</p>

<p>
  Or, some days are fine except the radio may not work, which is
  denoted as &not;R. The probability of the elementary event where
  everything else is good but the radio is out is obtained similarly,
  and the result is:
  <br><br>
  P(B) P(&not;R|B) P(I|B) P(G) P(S|I,G) P(M|S)
  <!--= 0.9 &times; 0.1 &times; 0.95 &times; 0.95 &times; 0.99 &times 99-->
  &asymp; 0.080.
  <br><br>
  Check that you get the same result by substituting the numbers from
  the CPTs in the correct places. Remember that &not;R means R=0 (see the
  hint above).
</p>

<p>
  You may ask what the point in all this business with the CPTs is:
  having to come up with all the numbers (parameters) in the CPTs
  looks like a lot of work. Why not just directly try to come up with
  the probabilities of the elementary events if that is the end
  result?  The answer is that we can sometimes save a whole lot of
  work this way. In the car example, the CPTs contain 2+4+4+2+8+4 = 24
  numbers, of which half are actually redundant since the numbers on
  each row must always sum up to one, i.e., there are really only 12
  numbers to choose.  The number of elementary events, on the other
  hand, is 2<sup>6</sup>=64, i.e., we would have to come up with 63
  parameters (the last one could be obtained by subtracting the others
  from 1.0). This shows how Bayesian networks can lead to <b>compact
    representation</b> of probabilistic models.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Exact inference in Bayesian networks

</h3>

<p>
  Compact representation of probabilistic models is only one of the
  two main advantages of Bayesian networks. The other advantage is
  efficient inference. Here we will discuss what we mean by inference,
  but to get to the <i>efficient</i> inference algorithms, you will have
  to study a bit more than this course.
</p>

<p>
  Just like in the above examples where we used Bayes rule and other
  probability calculus methods to compute posterior probabilities of
  the kind P(state | observations), we can do the same with Bayesian
  networks. Continuing with the car example, we can for example
  compute P(battery dead | radio doesn't work, car won't move), or
  P(&not;B | &not;R, &not;M), to figure out what is wrong with our car.
</p>

<p>
  So, let's get to work. We can start by writing the conditional
  probability as a ratio of two probabilities
  <pre>
                   P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;M)
  P(&notB | &not;R, &not;M) = -------------
                      P(&not;R, &not;M)</pre>
  To obtain these probabilities, we need to use the marginalization
  rule, which we have used before to write the annoying denominator
  as a sum of two terms. Here the sum will be composed of many
  terms instead of only two, but the basic principle is the same.
  The numerator becomes:<br><br>
  P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;M) = 
  &Sigma;<sub>&omega; &isin; (&not;B,&not;R,&not;M)</sub> P(&omega;) <br>
  = P(&not;B, &not;R, I, G, S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, I, G, &not;S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, I, &not;G, S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, I, &not;G, &not;S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;I, G, S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;I, G, &not;S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;I, &not;G, S, &not;M)<br>
  + P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;I, &not;G, &not;S, &not;M)<br><br>
  where &omega; &isin; (&not;B,&not;R,&not;M) denotes the set of
  elementary events that belong to the event (&not;B,&not;R,&not;M).
</p>

<p>
  We can now obtain the probability of each of the above eight
  elementary events by using the factorization into a product of
  conditional probabilities, and substituting the appropriate values
  into the product from the CPTs. Take the first one:<br><br>
  P(&not;B, &not;R, I, G, S, &not;M)
  = 0.1 &times; 1.0 &times; 0.0 &times; 0.95 &times; 0.0 &times; 1.0 = 0.0
  <br><br>
  which turns out to be equal to zero. Can you see why this makes sense?
  (Remember the meaning of &not;B and I. Can they happen at the same
  time?)
</p>

<p>
  The denominator in the formula for the posterior probability we wish
  to compute, P(&not;R, &not;M), can also be evaluated using the
  same technique. It will involve a sum of 16 terms since there are
  four variables that we need to sum over when we expand the
  event into a sum of elementary events. But if we work hard and
  do the math, we'll get the answer we need.
</p>

<p>
  We call this the <strong>brute-force</strong> approach, and it has
  the advantage that it always leads to exactly the right answer.
  Implementing the calculations in a computer avoids the tedious task
  of writing down large sums and manually calculating them.  However,
  in larger domains than our small car example, the calculations will
  become infeasible even for a computer. The problem is that the
  number of terms to be evaluated grows exponentially with respect to
  the number of variables in the model. That is why the more advanced
  and efficient inference algorithms that we've alluded to a few times
  are such an important thing. Another solution is to use <strong>
    approximate inference</strong>, which is our next topic.
</p>

<h3 class="material-heading">
    Generating data from a Bayesian network

</h3>

<p>
  In order to do approximate inference, we need to be able to generate
  (or sample) data from the joint distribution defined by a
  Bayesian network. The data will consist of <b>tuples</b>, each of
  which is essentially a list of values for each of the random
  variables in the domain. Thus, each tuple corresponds one-to-one
  to an elementary event &omega;.
</p>

<p>
  The algorithm to generate tuples is quite simple. We first choose
  values for any variables that have no parents. The choice is
  done randomly according to the distribution defined by the CPT.
  For example, to choose the value for the Battery variable in the
  car model, we use the distribution (0.1, 0.9). Similarly, the
  value of variable Gas is drawn from the distribution (0.05, 0.95).

  </div>

  <div class="hint__body">
    
<p>
  You have probably generated numbers from a pseudorandom number
  generator in your favorite programming language. In python, you may
  have used <code>random.random()</code>, and in Java, <code>Math.random()</code>.
  Both of these return pseudorandom floating point values in the range
  [0.0, 1.0). Other functions exist for generating random integers,
  Booleans, etc.</p>

<p>
  Some languages also have functions to generate categorical values
  (values in a finite set) from a given distribution. If your favorite
  language doesn't provide such functions, it is easy to apply the
  existing functions to implement them.
</p>

<p>
  For binary variables, the method works as follows. Let the
  probability of zero in the distribution you wish to sample from be
  some P(X=0). Generate a random floating point value <code>r</code>
  by the aforementioned functions. If <code>r</code> &lt; P(X=0), then
  output the value 0, and otherwise 1. Clearly a uniformly distributed
  value between 0 and 1 is less than P(X=0) with probability P(X=0), so
  our method produces value 0 with probability P(X=0), as it should.
</p>

<p>
  In the following, we will only need the binary case, but just in
  case you are interested: For categorical variables with more than
  two values, the method works in a similar fashion. The value 0 is
  produced if <code>r</code> is less than P(X=0). The value 1 is
  produced if <code>r</code> is between P(X=0) and P(X=0)+P(X=1). And
  generally, the value x is produced if
  <code>r</code> is between &Sigma;<sub>i=0</sub><sup>x-1</sup> P(X=i)
  = P(X=0) + ... + P(X=i-1).
</p>

<p>
  To choose values for the remaining variables, we proceed in such an
  order that when dealing with a variable, we have already chosen the
  value(s) for its parent(s). After choosing the value for Battery, we
  can thus move on to variable Radio. The distribution from which we
  choose the value of a child variable (such as Radio) is determined
  by the configuration of its parents (such as Battery). If B=1, then
  we draw the value of R from distribution (0.1, 0.9). Whereas if B=0,
  then we draw the value of R from distribution (1.0, 0.0) and the
  outcome is always R=0. No battery, no music.
</p>

<p>
  Note that when choosing the value of Starts, we need to chosen the
  values of both Ignition and Gas.
</p>

<p>
  Pseudocode for a generating N random tuples from a Bayesian network
  is as follows.
</p>
  
<pre class="sh_java code-highlight"><code>1: generate_tuples(N, model):
2:    for i = 1 to N:
3:       v = empty array
4:       for V in model.variables:
5:          pa = v[V.Pa]    # parents of V
6:          v.append(sample(V.CPT(pa)))
7:       output v 
</code></pre>

<p>
  In the pseudocode, <code>model</code> is an object that defines the
  Bayesian network model by giving for each variable V a set of 
  parents (in the form of a set of indices that can be used to
  select variables in the array v), and the corresponding CPTs.
  The selection operator v[V.Pa] extracts from the array v the
  elements that define the values of the parents of V. These
  are used on line 6 to choose the correct row from the CPT of V.
</p>

    Approximate inference (Monte Carlo)

</h3>

<p>
  The simplest approximate inference method is based on using the
  tuples sampled from a Bayesian network to estimate probilities
  directly as relative frequencies. To estimate the probability of an
  event, we simply draw a large number N of tuples, and count in how
  many of them the event occurs. The number of occurrences divided by
  N is then an estimate of the probability of the event.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, we get
  <pre>
                    #{tuples where B=0, R=0, M=0}
    P(&not;B, &not;R, &not;M) &asymp; -----------------------------
                                  N</pre>
</p>

<p>
  To approximate conditional probabilities, we simply write them as
  ratios, P(A | B) = P(A, B) / (B), and apply the same estimator to
  both the numerator and the denominator.
</p>

<p>
  This is a very simple and general technique, which belongs to the
  category of <strong>Monte Carlo</strong> techniques due to the use
  of chance in obtaining the results. The downside is that the
  result is not exact. The variance that is caused by the random
  nature of the process can sometimes make the obtained probabilities
  quite inaccurate. The more bigger the number of tuples, however, the
  better the accuracy, and in the limit as N &rarr; &infin; the
  approximation converges to the exact value.
